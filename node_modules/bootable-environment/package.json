As a special case, if an `all.js`\nscript exists, that file will be loaded for *all* environments, prior to the\nenvironment-specific script itself.\n\n## Tests\n\n    $ npm install\n    $ npm test\n\n## Credits\n\n  - [Jared Hanson](http://github.com/jaredhanson)\n\n## License\n\n[The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Jared Hanson <[http://jaredhanson.net/](http://jaredhanson.net/)>\n",
